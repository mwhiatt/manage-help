# ManageHelp
ManageHelp is a web application that seeks to provide a one-stop shop for businesses to schedule and communicate with employees. The project was originally started as a group project for Purdue University's CS30700 Software Engineering course in the spring 2023 semester. The courses objectives were to teach students industry-relevant software engineering standards, particularly group develpment using the Scrum method. Sprints 1-3 correspond to project's development for the course, with Sprint 4 corresponding to my personal refactorization and improvements to the project. See the docs folder for more information.
